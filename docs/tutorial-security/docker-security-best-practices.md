# Bài 5: Docker Security Best Practices

Docker containers have become an integral part of modern application development and deployment. However, with their widespread use comes the need for robust security measures. This guide will walk you through some best practices for securing your Docker environment.

## 1. Use Official Images

Always use official images from trusted sources. These images are regularly updated and patched for security vulnerabilities.

```bash
docker pull ubuntu:latest
```

## 2. Scan Images for Vulnerabilities

Use tools like Docker Scan or Trivy to check your images for known vulnerabilities.

```bash
docker scan myimage:latest
```

## 3. Limit Container Resources

Prevent DoS attacks by limiting container resources:

```bash
docker run -d --cpus=".5" --memory=512m nginx
```

## 4. Use Non-Root Users

Run containers as non-root users to minimize potential damage from container breakouts:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN groupadd -r myuser && useradd -r -g myuser myuser
USER myuser
```

## 5. Use Docker Content Trust

Enable Docker Content Trust to ensure image integrity:

```bash
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
docker pull ubuntu:latest
```

## 6. Implement Network Segmentation

Use Docker networks to isolate containers:

```bash
docker network create --driver bridge isolated_network
docker run --network=isolated_network -d nginx
```

## 7. Keep Docker Updated

Regularly update Docker to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

## 8. Use Security Options

Utilize Docker's security options:

```bash
docker run --security-opt=no-new-privileges nginx
```

## 9. Implement Logging and Monitoring

Use Docker's logging capabilities and consider integrating with monitoring solutions:

```bash
docker run --log-driver=syslog nginx
```

## 10. Secure Docker Daemon

Ensure the Docker daemon is only accessible by trusted users:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

By following these best practices, you can significantly enhance the security of your Docker environment. Remember, security is an ongoing process, so stay informed about the latest Docker security updates and recommendations.
